# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis  

## Business Task
Zomato is a multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. Analyze the business performance of customers registered in Zomato.  

Customer segmentation is the process by which we divide customers into groups based on common characteristics like demographics, geography, psychology, and behavior.  

## Data Set
- Users table (https://github.com/chiangsuanne/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis/blob/main/users.csv)
- Orders table (https://github.com/chiangsuanne/Customer-Segmentation-Analysis/blob/main/orders.csv)

## Tools
- Tableau for joining and cleaning data for analysis and visualization

## Analysis
RFM Analysis was performed to identify different groups of customers based on their past purchase behavior so that specific groups can be targeted and marketed.  

Customers are grouped into segments based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary scores.  

Frequency and Monetary attributes affect a customer's lifetime value, and Recency affects retention and the amount of engagement.

**RFM Customer Segments** - can visualize the strength of the customer group in terms of customer counts; Occasional Buyers and Loyal Customers comprise the most prominent groups.  

**RFM Segment Details** - provides many insights into each customer group; for example, Best Customers spend an average amount of $46,909, have made 4 orders, and their last purchase was around 87 days ago.  

**RFM Segment Sales Over Time** - can visualize trends such as both the spending and count of the Best Customers and Recent Buyers increasing from 2019 Q4 to 2020 Q1; however, both the amount spend and the count of Loyal Customers are falling during the same time period.  

## Recommendations
1. Targeted Marketing: Develop tailored marketing campaigns for different customer segments, offering promotions and incentives.  
2. Regional Expansion: Consider expanding services to areas with high customer potential.  
3. Customer Retention: Implement strategies to retain and engage frequent high spenders.
